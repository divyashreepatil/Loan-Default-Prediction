# Loan-Default-Prediction
Loan default prediction using Random Forest with GridSearchCV optimization — complete ML pipeline from preprocessing to final submission.

This project builds a machine learning model to predict whether a customer is likely to default on a loan using financial and demographic attributes. The goal is to support risk assessment and smarter loan approvals in the banking and finance sector.

🚀 Project Highlights

Implemented an end-to-end ML pipeline including data preprocessing, feature engineering and model training.

Used Random Forest Classifier with GridSearchCV hyperparameter tuning (96 parameter combinations, 288 fits).

Achieved 65.83% validation accuracy with optimized model configuration.

Exported a final prediction file as YourName_final_submission.csv.
